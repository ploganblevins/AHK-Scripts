Key Changes:
Added ExitApp:

The script now explicitly calls ExitApp at the end of the hotkey action to terminate itself once the task is completed.
This also ensures clean termination if the clipboard is empty or there's an error.
Panic Button (Escape Key):

Retains the ability to terminate the script at any time by pressing Esc.
Behavior:
The script runs when you press Ctrl+Shift+V (or your configured hotkey).
It processes the clipboard and exits immediately after completing the task.
If interrupted by Esc, the script terminates without completing the task.
Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
